# Skyrim Mod Manager
A simple mod manager for Skyrim, written in Python making use of PyQT.
It reads the contents of `Plugins.txt` and allows the user to enable/disable and reorder mods in a simple GUI.

SKMM will also read the contents of Skyrim's `Data` directory and compare that to `Plugins.txt` to detect any mods that have been removed or added.

## Usage
Its a Python script. Run it with `python ./skmm.py`
